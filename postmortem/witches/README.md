# Witches

> These are the witches that are available in the game. The withces should be hunted by the witch hunter. But each of them has a special ability that can be used to their advantage, also, they have a health bar, and when they are defeated, they will be added to the list of defeated witches. The defeated witches can be used to create a potion that can be used to heal the witch hunter. The witches can hurt the witch hunter, and the witch hunter can also use torture to get the testimony from the witches.
